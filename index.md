## Multivariate Regression Analysis and Gradient Boosting

### Multivariate Regression
In order to perform multivariate regression, we need to take a dataset and only use the features that we find to be important for our model. 
### Gradient Boosting
Gradient boosting utilizes a set of decision trees, each with a depth larger than 1, to predict a target label. Usually, these trees have their maximum number of leaves set between 8 and 32. 
### Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost)
Unlike gradient boosting, **xgboost** uses regularization parameters to help prevent overfitting of the data.
